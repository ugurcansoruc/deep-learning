# Deep Learning

This repository contains codes related to deep learning.

- Examples
  - [hello_tensorflow.py :](https://github.com/ugurcansoruc/deep-learning/blob/master/Examples/hello_tensorflow.py) ....
  - [image_files_to_labeled_dataset.py :](https://github.com/ugurcansoruc/deep-learning/blob/master/Examples/image_files_to_labeled_dataset.py)  Turns image files sorted into class-specific folders into a labeled dataset of image tensors.
  - [normalizing_features.py :](https://github.com/ugurcansoruc/deep-learning/blob/master/Examples/normalizing_features.py) Feature normalization via the Normalization layer. Normalization holds the mean and variance of your features.
  - [rescalling_center-cropping_images.py :](https://github.com/ugurcansoruc/deep-learning/blob/master/Examples/rescalling_center-cropping_images.py) Image rescaling and cropping.
  - [sequence_to_one_hot.py :](https://github.com/ugurcansoruc/deep-learning/blob/master/Examples/sequence_to_one_hot.py)  Turning strings into sequences of one-hot encoded bigrams.
  - [sequences_to_word_indices.py :](https://github.com/ugurcansoruc/deep-learning/blob/master/Examples/sequences_to_word_indices.py) Turning strings into sequences of integer word indices.
  - [text_files_to_labeled_dataset.py :](https://github.com/ugurcansoruc/deep-learning/blob/master/Examples/text_files_to_labeled_dataset.py) Turns text files sorted into class-specific folders into a labeled dataset of text tensors.
